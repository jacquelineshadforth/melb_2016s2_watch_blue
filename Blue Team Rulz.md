# Blue Team Charter #

* Be respectful, donâ€™t interrupt others, no blame games!
* __HAVE FUN__

## Commitment ##
* Put in your best effort, contribute and be present
* Take responsibility (ask for help if you are stuck)

## Best Practice ##

### Devs ###

* Always push 'green' code
* Always run tests before push
* Fix what you break
* Comment your code for other people

### XD/BA ###
* Be realistic, make sure the tasks are feasible for the devs
* Be specific when writing the requirements (and understandable)
